Long has human culture's sound dominated those of nature, here near the busy metropolis of San Diego.
At last, as nature and culture are meant to converge on this occasion, we give nature it's turn to take the lead.
The landscape of Cabrillo's seaside cliffs have defined a sound filter that gets its way with a sonic piece of our culture. A breath of fresh air. A glimpse of aural turmoil. Which side leads the dance?

The trace of Cabrillo's coastal cliffs define a sound filter that ravages a sonic cornerstone of southern Californian culture.
