# Sonar Test #1

  - using Analog to read sensor data works
  - using Pulse Width (PW) works too, and is supposedly more accurate. However the distance results seem a little off. Should go to MaxSonar datasheet to confirm distance settings.

## Conclusion

We will be using a RaspPi instead of an Arduino, finally.
JC's MaxSonar MB1000-LV-MaxSonar-EZ0 is old and not directly compatible with RaspPi.
Need to build an inverter to use it with the Pi, as seen [here](http://www.maxbotix.com/articles/074.htm).
